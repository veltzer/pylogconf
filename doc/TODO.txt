- if the 'setup()' method is called more than once then all logging fails.
	Make it not so.
- add a method disable_future_loggers() which disables adding any more handlers to
any more loggers in the future.
- make pylogconf work regularly if it doesn't find a yaml configuration file.
- add a command like utility that installs a yaml configuration file ~/.pylogconf.yaml
	into the users home directory.
